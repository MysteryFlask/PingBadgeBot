# Ping Bot for Discord

A extremely short Discord bot coded in Python, for beginners to creating slash commands, who wish to develop with them more, and also for people to be able to get the Discord active developer badge with no prior coding experience.

# Tutorial

Firstly, make sure Python is installed. For a guide on how to do this, go to https://realpython.com/installing-python/.

Then, install the Discord module for Python, by using `pip install Discord` in your command prompt/terminal.

Next, download the main.py file from this repository, and note down where it is being stored on your computer.

Finally, open the code in a text editor, I recommend Notepad++, and wherever I have added a note, change that to the value I say there. More info below.

## Notes

You will see that in the code you need a 'Discord bot token' and a 'Guild ID'. 

You can get your Discord bot token by following the tutorial on this website: https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/.

You can get your guild/server ID, by enabling Discord developer mode in settings, going to the Discord server you wish to use it in and clicking on the dropdown, then copy ID.

## IMPORTANT

- For the active developer badge, the server must be a 'community server' which is an option anyone can enable in server settings luckily, but make sure to turn it on.

- The process is not instant. Between you doing your command and you being able to claim the badge, there may be a 24 hour wait, so please be patient.

- For newbies: DO NOT SHARE YOUR BOT TOKEN ANYWHERE PUBLIC!
